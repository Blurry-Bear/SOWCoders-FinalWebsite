<h2> About Me </h2>

<p class="space">
  I’m a teenager who has a story. That may seem rather plain but it’s the truth. Just like millions of other teens, I also have my own story. My story has many ups and many downs, and some may say that’s just “life”. Funny, how we personify life like it’s the mastermind that controls everything behind the curtain. People tend to take a hypothetical beating from “life” and do nothing about it because of that same statement. If someone didn’t just stand there getting beaten maybe I wouldn’t have so many downs.
  <br>
  My downs are my mental struggles and it got amplified by the stress of trying to succeed and there being no one to help me. I felt like someone covered what was once a sunny day with a dark cloth when my mental and physical health declined. No matter what I did, whether it be going to a therapist or talking to doctors, I just kept falling into the abyss. The cherry on top of this chapter in my story is when I found out that my country does not have any suicide hotline.
  <br>
  It’s like they were setting me up for failure and I was so close to falling into the trap. It took me a long time to get out of that. Now that I am better, I would like to take this chance to help those who are were or currently are in my position or worse.
